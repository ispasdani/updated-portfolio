                        <h2>Hi, there</h2>
                        <p>My name is Daniel-Nicolae Ispas and I am a Full-Stack Developer currently working for Netcompany.</p>
                        <h2>Long story made short about me...</h2>
                        <p>Ex professional tennis player who realised that he is not going to be the next Rafael Nadal, so dream over.</p>
                        <p>My journey as a programmer started a long time ago. I always had this passion for computers and for the ability to build games and apps. I remember the moment when my parents bought me my first computer and I was spending my time only by going through different folders and playing Mortal Kombat. For me, at that time it meant everything. Easily I started to read about programming and how I can build my first game. Of course I was just a kid and I was not able to understand how complex thisÂ world is, plus I was a tennis player and I loved that too. So for many years this was just something that I was doing in my free time as a passion.</p>
                        <p>Six years ago I stopped playing tennis and decided to go all in with programming. The fact that I already had some experience was a plus of course. My focus was on Web Development and Mobile Development because I liked the idea of building something that people can interact with. I think that on these fields you can see the results more easily and it's more enjoyable. </p>
